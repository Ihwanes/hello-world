# hello-world
Finally I'm trying to use GitHub after 1 year using GitLab. Wish me luck!

In this hello-world tutorial, I would like to write a bit about myself. First, my name is Ihwan Edi Saputro and you can call me Ihwan or Iwan. I'm 20 y.o., an IT student that still can do nothing. This day, I want to change myself so I can do every project. I like travelling, especially just using my motorcycle, I also like drinking coffee, watching YouTube, playing game, and swimming.

Currently I'm using Java, I want to review my Python Skills and the Front-End stuff.

That's all for today, see you later!
